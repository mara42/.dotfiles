# Tmux

## About

Tmux is a great tool for multiplexing session if you don't have access to (or don't want to use) [terminator](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html) or [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/). Its configuration after installation is symlinked to your `$HOME` directory and the temporary session is created to source the configuration.

## Configuration:

* Mouse support
* [caiogondim/maglev](https://github.com/caiogondim/maglev) theme which follows the `vim powerline` style
* [TPM](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) - tmux plugin manager
