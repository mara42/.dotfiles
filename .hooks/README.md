# Git hooks

## What are hooks

Git hooks are run during specific git actions. Example codes and behaviours are available to check in `.git/hooks`. Unfortunetly those can't be kept in the repository so it's considered a good practice to include them in different directory with instructions how to use and install hooks.

## Installing hooks

Just enter this directory with cd and run `install.sh`

## What do they do

After each commit your vscode plugins are updated, so this repository contains your actuall set of plugins. Also snippets for git configuration are compiled to one file included in the global config.
